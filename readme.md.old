## Expectations

**Note: The specification is always correct**

You are welcome to use any methods, frameworks or tools for testing. You may also use any ECMA language version you like.

We would like to see the following implemented for this test

1. Unit test back end
2. Acceptance testing front end
3. Fix any issues you tests may catch

Along with the implementation of the tests, you may change the code in any way required to make it fully match the
specification

Bonus points for NPM integration (Using `package.json`) for running commands (e.g. `npm test`)
